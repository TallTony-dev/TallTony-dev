## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<!-- ![fixed github-gif](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35393c27-bb26-4eed-8499-e7c10d4f765e) -->

I'm a first year Computer Engineering student at UWaterloo who is currently interested in learning embedded systems, and the firmware programming and circuit design that comes along with it. There isn't too much on here at the moment, but I'm looking to develop more projects to both improve and have proof of my skills.
